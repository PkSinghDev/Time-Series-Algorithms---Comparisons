# Time-Series-Algorithms---Comparisons
## Compare Performances of various Time Series Algorithms
#### Project Overview <br />
Overview:: In this Project we shall look at the following points :-
a. The basics of Time-Series
b. Common features in Time-Series Data
c. Model Explorations - Compare Holt-Winters, SARIMAX, Prophet, XGBOOST and Neural Network for Time Series analysis
The dataset we will be using is GitHub page of John Hopkins Center for System Science and Engineering: [here](https://medium.com/r/url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCSSEGISandData%2FCOVID-19%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fcsse_covid_19_data%2Fcsse_covid_19_time_series)
